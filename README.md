# Store-Wheels

This project open for me the new world of web tehnologies with fancy interface and custom Srever Side logic.

It is full stack online wheels store created with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.

The application has five main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems — all of which are relational.

The app also includes many server side bits including JWT authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.
