It is full stack online wheels store created with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.

The application has five main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems — all of which are relational.

The app also includes many server side bits including JWT authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.
